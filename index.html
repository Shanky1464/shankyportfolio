            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I am a passionate and dedicated Computer Science Engineer with a strong foundation in algorithms, and system design. My interest in technology began at a young age, and over the years, I've developed a diverse skill set that spans multiple programming languages, including C,C++,Java,Python, as well as experience in web development, data structures, and databases.
                <br>
                &ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;&ThickSpace;I thrive in solving complex problems and enjoy working on both individual and collaborative projects. My approach to engineering is rooted in a commitment to innovation and efficiency, ensuring that the solutions I develop are not only functional but also optimized for performance and scalability. Whether it's building web applications, exploring new technologies, or diving deep into systems architecture, I'm always eager to learn and improve.
            
                When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me playing cricket or chess or video games
